# Carrie-the-Carebot

	• Key Research Question: What is the extent to which chatbots can assist informal dementia caregivers?
	• Scraped the frequently asked questions regarding dementia caregiving on the web and structured the question categories with the existing categories of questions
	• Built and deployed Telegram chatbot by using C# on Microsoft Azure Framework V4 SDK with QnA Maker
	• Interviewed caregivers and dementia professionals at dementia centers in the Flanders region and Amsterdam about what questions they have or had and what questions they would ask a chatbot
	• Updated the chatbot to be more region-specific to the Flanders region by scraping legal questions regarding dementia and tested it on the official webpage of Expertisecentrum Dementie Vlaanderen for two weeks to investigate the difference between the actual and expected usage of the chatbot by caregivers
